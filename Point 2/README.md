# Subtask 2:

1. In this task we have to compare 2 neural networks performance on the MNIST dataset
    * Train on Randomly initialized network
    * Train on 0-9 digits of custom dataset used in Point 1 and then train it on MNIST
2. For both these tasks, the custom CNN performs the best, hence comparative analysis is done on this network
